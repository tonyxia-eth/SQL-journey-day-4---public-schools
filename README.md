## Overview
This is part of my ongoing journey to learn SQL, specifically through CS50's Introduction to Databases course. Today marks Day 4, and I'm focused on querying and retrieving specific data from the database. The goal today was to get all public schools from the provided database.

## SQL Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM schools
WHERE type = 'Public';
# SQL-journey-day-4---public-schools

Key Concepts
SELECT Statement: Used to retrieve data from the database.

WHERE Clause: Filters records to meet certain conditions.

Filtering by Type: In this case, selecting only public schools.

Challenges
Understanding how different clauses interact and how to filter data efficiently.

Working through different types of data (e.g., public vs. private schools) and ensuring accurate filtering.

Next Steps
Continue refining queries to include more complex conditions and joins.

Experiment with different data types and functions in SQL.
